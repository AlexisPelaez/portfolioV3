              <p class="text-center text-white">Aerospace engineering is the primary field of engineering concerned with the design, development, testing, and production of aircraft, spacecraft, and related systems and equipment. With there being two major and overlapping branches, the Aeronautical engineering branch, and the Astronautical engineering branch. The Aeronautical engineering branch focuses on the theory, technology, and practice of flight within the earth's atmosphere. The Astronautical engineering branch focuses on the science and technology of spacecraft and launch vehicles.</p>

              <p class="text-center text-white">The range of the salary of an average aerospace engineer is between 93K to 170K. Some statistics that go along with Aerospace engineering involve the following. The Aerospace engineering workforce numbered 138K in 2021, with the average age of an Aerospace engineer being 43.5 years old. The average male salary was reported at $121,974 while the average female salary was reported at $106,906. Aerospace engineers are most often employed by the Aircraft & parts manufacturing industry</p>

              <h1 class="text-center text-white"><u>What Aerospace Engineers Do</u></h1>
              <p class="text-center text-white">As an aerospace engineer, you develop technologies for use in aviation, defense systems, and spacecraft. They often focus on areas such as aerodynamic fluid flow; structural design; guidance, navigation, and control; instrumentation and communication; robotics; or propulsion and combustion. Aerospace engineers may design specific aerospace products, such as commercial and military airplanes and helicopters; remotely piloted aircraft and rotorcraft; spacecraft, including launch vehicles and satellites; and military missiles and rockets.</p>
