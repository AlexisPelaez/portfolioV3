            <p class="text-center text-white">A video game or computer game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface or input device (such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion sensing device) to generate visual feedback from a display device, most commonly shown in a video format on a television set, computer monitor, flat-panel display or touchscreen on handheld devices, or a virtual reality headset.</p>

            <p class="text-center text-white">I play video games often and is the main part of my hobbies. I have some genres I enjoy, them being RPG games, Visual novels, combat games, or even turn based action games. I enjoy most video games and some of my favorite include Pokemon, Roblox, Danganronpa. I often play these games and they've left an impact within me and I will be able to hold a long conversation if anyone discussed on of these mentioned to me.</p>

            <p class="text-center text-white">Journaling can mean many things such as writing in a diary, writing therapy, journal therapy, journaling file system, or electronic message journaling but the most common and popular form is the use of a diary.

            <h3 class="text-center text-white"><u>How I use Journaling</u></h3>
            <p class="text-center text-white">I journal somewhat often now, but I used to journal every single day back then with each entry lasting about a page and a half. When I first began, they only took up about half a page or even a quarter, but now they take up more than a page and a half. I would always write down anything I noticed that I had seen in the day, some of my thoughts, and even some struggles I've been in. </p>

            <h3 class="text-center text-white"><u>Walking</u></h3>
            <p class="text-center text-white">Walking is a form of locomotion for all land creatures such as humans, animals, bugs, and all land lifeforms. Walking can also be the act of going for a stride for a breather, to get some exercise, to view your surrounding scenery, hanging out with friends, or any reason that suits you.</p>

            <h3 class="text-center text-white"><u>How I Use Walking</u></h3>
            <p class="text-center text-white">Although I don't walk often, when I'm able to, I always enjoy it. Walking is one of my favorite activites to do when I leave my home because I usually walk in forests, or parks and I'm able to enjoy the scenery. The sky I see of the sunset, the clouds moving around changing color, and the dark sky that comes after. Or even in the day, the light that shines all over the land is beautiful and brings life to everything around me.</p>
